# HDLLogicDesignProject_Rework
This repository is used to upload the HDL Logic Design Project (Perpentual Calendar) Rework. 
This course belongs to the 2nd semester of 1st year but now I want to rework it because the old source code has many bad things that I have to improve.
Through this Rework version, I will use System Verilog to develop the system instead of Verilog to learn more about SV.
Because I do not have Arty-Z7 Board, I only develop this project source code, then run synthesis and simulation wwith testbench.
